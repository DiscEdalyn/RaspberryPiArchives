# Raspberry Pi Archives

These are 3 of the many short assigments I've done using a Raspberry Pi, all coded in Python.

Email.py: Connects to a database hosted in Hostinger, depending on the status of the presence sensor, it sends the data to said database and sends an email telling that there was movement detected and turns LEDs.

RGBUltra.py: Using a common cathode LED, changes the colors of said LED depending on the distance detected by said sensor, and sends the data to a database hosted in Hostinger.

Practica6-SensorTemp.py: Using a temperature sensor, reaching certain thresholds in temperature sends data to a database and turns on LEDs.
